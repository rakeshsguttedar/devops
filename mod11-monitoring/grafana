Grafana

Grafana is an open source monitoring and analytics tool which helps us to visualize the analysis 
of data from the servers in a human readabale form like charts, graphs,etc. Grafana does not
directly fetch the data from the source. It receives data from Data Sources tools. Hence it is 
not a monitoring tool as such but an analysis and visualisation tool that makes data human readable.

Components in a Monitoring System

Application/website/ <------- Exporter -------> Data Source ------> analytics/visual report
 Jenkins/Git <--------- Blackbox Exporter ----> Prometheus ------->     Grafana
                        Node Exporter

Data source
In monitoring, a data source refers to any system, component, or entity that generates data or
metrics relevant to monitoring the health, performance, or behavior of a system, application, 
or infrastructure. Data sources provide the raw information that is collected, aggregated, and 
analyzed by monitoring tools to gain insights into the monitored environment.

Data Sources tools -
Prometheus,
Victoria Metrics
Influxdb
Loki,

Prometheus - time series data source - if time interval is 5 mins, it fetches the data every 5 min
- has its own Blackbox exporter
- uses pull approach to fetch/scrape the data
- suitable for small or medium applications/infratr

Victoria metrics - high volume data source

influxDb
- uses Push approach
- It is better version of Prometheus

Loki - log aggregation tool - fetches the Logs

Exporters

Exporters in monitoring tools are software components or agents that collect metrics and
data from specific sources (e.g., systems, applications, services) and expose them in a 
format that can be scraped and consumed by monitoring systems like Prometheus.
Examples of Exporters are Blackbox Exporter, Node Exporter, JMX Exporter, SNMP Exporter, etc.

Exporters collect metrics data from the system or application and expose it via HTTP 
endpoints in a standardized format (e.g., Prometheus exposition format).

In summary, while both data sources and exporters provide metrics and data for monitoring 
purposes, data sources represent the origin or generator of the data, whereas exporters are
specialized components responsible for collecting and exposing metrics data in a consumable 
format for monitoring tools. Exporters act as intermediaries that facilitate the integration 
of diverse data sources into a centralized monitoring system.

For most monitoring scenarios, exporters are still the preferred method for collecting metrics 
from diverse data sources, as they provide a standardized and scalable approach for integrating 
with Prometheus. Exporters allow Prometheus to collect metrics from a wide range of systems, 
applications, and services, enabling comprehensive monitoring and observability.

Handson with 2 applications

1. Jenkins on a server
2. Basic website

Example: Information on plugins in jenkins, no. of pipelines, when was the last pipeline job
triggered, etc.

Grafana Explore is a workflow for troubleshooting and data exploration. In this step, youâ€™ll be using Explore to create ad-hoc queries to understand the metrics exposed by the sample application.

Ad-hoc queries are queries that are made interactively, with the purpose of exploring data. An ad-hoc query is commonly followed by another, more specific query.
