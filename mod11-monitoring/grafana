2 applications

1. Jenkins on a server
2. basic website

Example: Information on plugins in jenkins, no. of pipelines, when was the last pipeline job
triggered, etc.

Grafana
Grafana is an open source monitoring and analytics tool which helps us to visualize the analysis 
of the servers in a human readabale form like charts, bar graphs,etc. Grafana does not directly 
fetch the data from the source. It receives data from Data Sources tools. Hence it is not a 
monitoring tool as such but an analysis and visualisation tool to make data human readable.

Data source

Data Sources tools -
Prometheus,
Loki,
Influxdb

Prometheus - time series data source - if time interval is 5 mins, it fetches the data every 5 min
- has its own Blackbox exporter
- uses pull approach to fetch/scrape the data
- suitable for small or medium applications/infratr

Victoria metrics - high volume data source

influxDb
- uses Push approach
- It is better version of Prometheus

Loki - log aggregation tool - fetches the Logs

Exporters in monitoring tools such as Blackbox Exporter and Node Exporter are components that
collect metrics and data from specific sources (e.g., systems, applications, services) and expose
them in a format that can be scraped and consumed by monitoring systems like Prometheus.
