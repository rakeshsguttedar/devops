Monitoring and Observability (o11y)

Monitoring
Monitoring is the ability to collect and analyse the data generated by various 
systems, resources, applications and infrastructure components in order to assess 
their health, performance, and availability.

Monitoring focuses on collecting and analyzing predefined metrics and indicators
to assess the health, performance, and availability of systems, applications, and 
infrastructure components.

- tracking specific metrics, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, response times, 
error rates, etc., over time to detect anomalies, trigger alerts, and ensure system 
reliability.

- proactive and structured approach, where predefined metrics are monitored, thresholds
are set, and alerts are triggered based on predefined conditions or thresholds.

Observability
Observability is ability to understand and debug complex systems based on their 
external outputs, behaviors, and interactions and gaining insights into system behavior
and performance by analyzing logs, traces, events, and other telemetry data, rather than
relying solely on predefined metrics.

Monitoring and observability are complementary capabilities and are not the same.
Monitoring focuses on tracking predefined metrics to assess system health and performance,
wheras observability goes beyond monitoring by providing insights into the internal state
and behavior of systems based on their external outputs and telemetry data.

Why monitoring?

When traffic on a website increases due to various reasons, the traffic would overwhelm
the system resources (such as CPU and memory) of the server. As a result, the website 
would get overloaded and gets crashed. We cannot always sit and observe the website 
traffic. Though we can use some simple tools like meminfo and top to check the CPU and 
memory usage of the server, it needs to be done manually. Observing the resource usage 
manually is not always feasible and this itself is a problem statement for us to have 
an automation system for monitoring of server resources.
