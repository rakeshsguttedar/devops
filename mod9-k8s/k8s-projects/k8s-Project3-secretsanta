Kubernetes Project 3: SecretSanta-Generator

This project is very similar to k8s Project 2 as both are java based projects.

So we can save some time and effort if we can reuse
1. The Project 2 setup of 5 AWS EC2 instances. 
1. The project 2 Jenkins Pipleine script and create a new Jenkins pipeline job
   with the same pipeline script by making little modifications to it.

Changes needed in Jenkins Pileline Script:
1. Edit the Git Checkout stage and using pipeline syntax generate the 
   script for checking out the code for this project.
2. Edit projectKey and projectName in sonar-scanner command.   
3. Since Secret Santa generator does not have the problem of test 
   cases getting failed, we can remove the flag for skipping of test cases.
3. Edit docker image name to rockondock/secret-santa for docker build,
   docker push and trivy image commands.

Other changes:
1. Add k8-dep-svc.yml file to scretsanta-generator project root if not
   already present and edit the image name.
   spec.template.spec/containers.image: rockondock/secret-santa:latest
2. Copy the <dependencyManagement> element of pom.xml of project 2 to
   this project pom.xml file.
