Taints and Tolerations are the mechanisms in Kubernetes to configure
scheduling of pods on a Node based on the attribute set on the Node.
Setting of an attribute on a Node is called tainting of node. A node 
is tainted to ensure that no pod is scheduled on that node unless a
pod is configured to tolerate this node by using the same attribute
that is set on the Node. A Pod is said to be tolerant to a tainted 
node if the tainted Node attribute is set as tolerations on that Pod.

Taints and Tolerations are configured at the Node Level because Node 
is the point of focus for the scheduling behaviour of pods.

Attribute - An attribute is in the form - 

key=value:Effect 

where 
key=value is the property and its value 
Effect is the behaviour of the Pods for that attribute.

The possible values for Effect are 
NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

NoSchedule ensures no pods are scheduled on this node.
Pods with tolerations for key=value will be allowed to be
be scheduled on that node. Pods without the tolerations for
key=value are not scheduled on this node. But already 
scheduled non-tolerant pods continue to run unless evicted 
because of other reasons.

PreferNoSchedule can allow scheduling of pods without the tolerations 
for key=value on that node. This effect is used when you want to 
discourage scheduling pods onto specific nodes but allow it if necessary.

NoExecute will evict the Pods without tolerations if they are already
Sceduled on that Node. This effect ensures that only pods with tolerations
for the taint are running on the node.

Let us explain using an example.
We can taint a particular node using the command

kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:effect


If the attributes are set on the node, it is called
tainting of Node. If the same attribute is set on the Pod, it is 
called Toleration. Therefore Taints are set on Nodes and Tolerations 
are set on the pods.


Command format for tainting of a node
kubectl taint nodes <node-name>  key=value:effect
Example

tolerations:
  - key: 
    operator:
    value: 
    effect:
