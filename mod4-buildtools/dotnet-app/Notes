Dotnet applicaiton has dependencies configured in .csproj files for each project.
appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json files will have configuraion related
settings for each project. source codes are stored inside .cs files.

A dotnet based application can have multiple projects located inside ./src folder.
For example, the eStoreLite project @ https://github.com/davidfowl/eStoreLite.git
has three projects: Frontend, CatalogService and StartTimer.

In root folder, there will be a .sln file which will contain application wide
configuration for projects inside the application.
nuget.config will contain the repository for storing artifacts inside jfrog or nexus 
like artifact repositories.
