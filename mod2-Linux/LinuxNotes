var  - logs and cache
root - root user or super user home directory
tmp  - temporary files and folders - will delete these files when the system gets rebooted
mnt  - contains mount point for mounting external storage devices  
dev  - devices files
media - contains mount point
srv - service - data files for services like http service static files etc..
opt - optional - used for installing third party softwares which are not managed by the package manager
sbin - contains essntial system binaries for managing the system - specifically for the root user of the system - sysadmin

Commands:
---------
ls, pwd, Ctrl + L clear screen , ls -l 
to see hidden files: ls -la
creating files: touch commnad
moving/renaming file: mv file1 to file2 or mv file1 to folder2
cp oldfile newfile
whatis cmd is to find about the command cmd
which cmd is to find the location of the command cmd

user management in linux
========================
3 types of users:

1. Sudo root user
2. normal user
3. service account user

root user - has full privilages and has full access access
normal user having limited access to the linux system
service account - Jenkins create a user named jenkins and also creates a group named jenkins

the command 

 sudo su 

to switch to the root user

There are 2 commands to create users:
1. useradd - not user friendly command to create a user  but it used inside scripts to create a user
2. adduser - user friendly command to add a user - mostly used for creating users through command line


using sudo - super user do - elevated privilage for user running this command
 sudo adduser rakesh

To switch to a user name john
 su - rakesh

To add user to a group using the below command.

 sudo usermod -g rakesh rakesh
 #output: usermod: no changes

Option -g (small g) will oveeride the permission of the user with the permission of the group
In the above command, the user rakesh is already part of group rakesh. hence no changes output.
Instead of rakesh group, if we add user to another group, say for example a group named mygrp,
then the permissions of user rakesh is overriden with the permissions of the group mygrp.

# to create group in linux
 sudo addgroup devops 
 sudo addgroup infra 

Two groups will be created using above commands

To add user rakesh to the group devops and infra: 

 sudo usermod -G devops,infra  rakesh

Option -G (capital G) will add user rakesh to the group devops and infra and also 
add permissions of these groups to the user rakesh

Commands to check user and group creation:
 cat /etc/passwd
 cat /etc/group

commands to delete user and to delete groups
 sudo deleteuser rakesh
 sudo deletegroup devops
 sudo deletegroup infra

vi / Vim Editor
===============

Editing a file in the vi / vim editor
-------------------------------------

Command mode:
------------
(by pressing escape inside a vi editor, the vi editor will enter Command mode)
The cursor will move based on the below commands.

 double type g (gg)  -  to the beginning of the file
 shift +  G  - to the end of the current file
 0 - move the cursor to the beginning of the current line
 $ - move the the cursor to the end of the current line
 w - moves to the beginning of the next word
 b - moves back to the beginning of the current word
 /searchwordorpattern: will search for the word in text, 
     typing  n will search for the word in the forward direction 
     typing  N will search for the word in the backward direction 
 :%s/old/new/gc - search and replace the word 'old' with the word 'new'
                  globally(g),  ask for confirmation (c)

Entering Editing mode:
----------------------
(When vi editor is in Command mode, by typing i, the vi editor will enter editing mode)
To enter Editing mode in a vi editor at a specific place:
 i - edit at the current cursor
 a - edit at the next letter from the current cursor
 A - enters editing mode at the end of the current line
 I - enters editing mode at the start of the current line
 o - opens a new line below the current line
 O - opens a new line above the current line

 r - replace the character under the cursor
 x - delete the character under the cusror
 d2 - delete next 2 lines including the current line 
 dd - delete the current line
 u -  undo the last command/action - works in Command mode
 Ctrl +  r - redo the last command/action
 shift + 3 : search for the word under the current cursor



Linux Part 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permissions for files and folders
=================================

cd devopsshack
mkdir dir1
cd dir1
touch 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt
ls -l

drwxrwxr-x ubuntu ubuntu

d -directory
rwx - read write execute permission for user ubuntu
rwx - read write execute permission for group ubuntu
r-x - read and execute pemission for other users
  
r - read permission is denoted by      4
w - write permission is denoted by     2
x - execute permission is denoted by   1         1

r-4
w-2
x-1

7 - all permissions 
6 - read and write permissions only 
5-  read and execute only
4 - read permission only

The command: 
 sudo chmod 600 1.txt

assign read and write pernission to file 1.txt for the user and no permissions for group and other users

 sudo chmod 777 2.txt

Assigning permission to the folder and for all the files inside the folder:

 cd .. # go to the parent dir dir1
 sudo chmod 777 -R dir1

The above command will change the permission of the folder and recursively (with option -R) 
change the permissions of all the files and folders inside the folder dir1

 sudo chmod 755 -R dir1

The above command will change the permission of the folder and recursively (with option -R) 
change the permissions of all the files and folders inside the folder dir1
 

Symbolic method of assigning permission to the files and folders
----------------------------------------------------------------

u - user
g - group
o - others

g-x
o=rw- 
u=r-x
o=--x   # execute permission only for other users
o=---   # remove all permissions for other users

 chmod g+x -R dir1
# adding execute permission to the group associated with folder dir1 and all the files and folders inside dir1 

 chmod o+x -R dir1
# adding execute permission to others for folder dir1 and all the files and folders inside dir1 

 chmod u=r-x -R dir1
# adding read and execute permission to the user of the folder dir1 and for all the files and folders inside dir1 

Changing Ownership and group
---------------------------

sudo chown root:root -R dir1



Linux - PArt 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package managers

repositories

tree command

apt - advanced packaging tool

sudo apt install tree

apt-get command des not show progress
apt command has progress bar

sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless -y

-y option will not give prompt for confirmation

java --version

To remove a package

sudo apt remove tree


install jenkins
---------------

if package is not available in the package manager 
repository then we can download the package

wget command to download and add the jenkins package to the repository of package manager

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins


Curl command can also be used.
curl has more features. 
curl can be used to access the application if we dont have a browser to check the application.


curl -O linktothearchive


curl is slower compared to wget


ifconfig 
ifconfig eth0
ip -a
ip addr show

ping command : ping ICMP echo

nslookup google.com
traceroute google.com
netstat -tuln
ss
route
hostname

host ip-address

dig google.com

curl google.com
ssh -i keyfile username@ipaddress
