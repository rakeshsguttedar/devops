Github Actions

Using cloud VMs or AWS EC2 instances will costs us some money. You can avoid
using these VMs and use Github Actions to run our CICD pipeline. The advantage
is that we need not install a seperate tool for setting up the CICD pipeline. 
We can use the Gihub Provided Actions workflow and setup the pipeline to build
our sourcecode.

To build applications using Github Action

-> Go to Project repo in github

-> click on Actions Menu.
It will enable Actions for this project if anot already enabled.
Workflows page is created. Where we can add workflows, list already added 
workflows and manage runners.

Prebuilt OS docker images Images:

-> Click on "New workflow" button
Gihub will open a page containing prebuilt OS images and we can select one
of these images to run our pipeline.

This page will also suggest some prebuilt images of Github based on our project
repository. We can select an image "Java with Maven" for our project and 
-> click on Configure.

Inside our project repository, a folder named
BoardgameListingWebApp/.github/workflows/maven.yml is automatically created.

The maven.yml file is a workflow file same as Jenkinsfile pipeline file.
We can edit this maven.yml file and configure it.
Once editing of maven.yml is done, you can Commit the Changes to start the Build
process.
