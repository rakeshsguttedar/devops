Terraform Workspaces

They are a terraform feature to manage multiple environments such as staging, dev and production
using environment specific statefiles within a single Terraform configuration directory.

Advantages:
1. Prevents conflicts between envionments
2. Allows applying configuration changes to each envionment in a controlled and organized manner.
3. State management is isolated and specific to the environment. Therefore chnages in one 
   environment will not affect the other.
4. Allows Variable overrides - it allows to use same configuration for different environments
   by using environment specific variable definition and thus reduces duplication of code. 
5. Allows us to manage mulitple envionments using a single terraform commands workflow.
