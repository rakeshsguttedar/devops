Terraform import

Starting from Terraform version 1.5, the Terraform import functionality has been enhanced. 
Previously, it solely imported pre-existing resources that were not managed by Terraform, 
typically manually created resources. Initially, this command merely updated the 
`terraform.tfstate` file, necessitating the creation of `.tf` files based on the state files. 
This process proved cumbersome, particularly for large infrastructures with numerous resources.

With the latest version, Terraform not only imports the resources but also generates the 
corresponding Terraform configuration files. This significant improvement has substantially 
reduced the time required to create configuration files for existing resources.

Hands-on:

# import.tf
provider "aws" {
    region = "ap-south-1"
}

import {
    to = aws_security_group.mysg
    id = "sg-09e429631952a5913"
}

terraform plan -generate-config-out=my-security-group.tf

After we run the above terraform plan command, a configuration file by the name 
my-security-group.tf gets created.

We can go through the configuration file, and if all resources match with the existiing
resources in AWS, we can apply as shown below

terraform apply

Before applying, these resources were not managed by terraform.
After applying, terraform will manage the imported infrastructure resources.
