Terraform Modules

Modules in Terraform are reusable Terraform configurations packages that represent a set
of resources or infrastructure components. 

Advantages/features

Terraform Modules:
1. encapsulate the terraform configuration as a single unit 
2. abstract away the implementation details and expose a clean interface
3. make terraform configurations reusable - we can package common infrastructure patterns, 
   such as web servers, databases, or networking configurations and resuse them.
4. Modules can be stored locally within the same Terraform configuration directory or 
   fetched from remote sources, such as version control repositories or module registries. 
   This allows for flexibility in managing module dependencies and sharing modules with others.
5. We can use modules as building blocks to assemble larger infrastructure components. 
   As a result, it reduces the complexity of managing large infrastructure components.
6. Can be Version controlled or tracked and helps with the collaboration.

Overall, Terraform modules provide a powerful mechanism for organizing, sharing, and reusing
infrastructure configurations. They help improve productivity, maintainability, and collaboration 
in managing infrastructure as code with Terraform.
