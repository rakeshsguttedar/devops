Q. What are Explicit and Implicit dependencies in Terraform?

In Terraform, a "dependency" refers to a relationship between resources, 
where one resource depends on another resource to be created or updated. 
There are two types of dependencies in Terraform:
1. Explicit Dependency
2. Implicit Dependency

1. Explicit Dependency: This is a direct relationship between two resources 
that is explicitly defined in the Terraform configuration using the 
"depends_on" parameter.

When one resource depends on another resource, Terraform will create or 
update the dependent resource after the resource it depends on has been 
created or updated.

For example, if you have a web server that depends on a database server, 
you can define the dependency explicitly by adding the following to your 
Terraform configuration:

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
# ... other configuration ...

depends_on = [aws_instance.database]
}

resource "aws_instance" "database" {
# ... other configuration ...
}

This tells Terraform that the "web" instance depends on the "database" instance, 
and Terraform will ensure that the "database" instance is created or updated 
before the "web" instance.


2. Implicit Dependency: This is an indirect relationship between two resources 
that is not explicitly defined in the Terraform configuration.

Terraform will automatically detect implicit dependencies based on the resource 
attributes or references used in the configuration.

For example, if you have a security group that allows traffic from a certain IP 
address range, and you create an EC2 instance that uses that security group, 
Terraform will detect the implicit dependency between the instance and the 
security group. Terraform will create or update the security group before creating
or updating the instance, to ensure that the security group exists and allows the 
necessary traffic.

In summary, explicit dependencies are direct relationships between resources that 
are explicitly defined in the Terraform configuration using "depends_on", while 
implicit dependencies are indirect relationships that are automatically detected 
based on the resource attributes used in the configuration.
