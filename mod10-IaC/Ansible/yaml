YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language
yaml formatted data is stored in a yaml file with .yml or .yaml extension

yaml is a most popular programming language that is mainly used for storing 
configuration information and for storing and transporting data between processes.

It is a data serialization language. It's often used as a format for configuration files, 
but its object serialization abilities make it a viable replacement for languages like JSON. 

YAML is easy for humans to read, which is why it's a good choice for configuration. 

Below is a sample yaml file

# comment in yaml 
---
 doe: "a deer, a female deer"
 ray: "a drop of golden sun"
 pi: 3.14159
 xmas: true
 french-hens: 3
 calling-birds:
   - huey
   - dewey
   - louie
   - fred
 xmas-fifth-day:         # this is another comment
   calling-birds: four
   french-hens: 3
   golden-rings: 5
   partridges:
     count: 1
     location: "a pear tree"
   turtle-doves: two

Three dashes
The file starts with three dashes. These dashes indicate the start of a new YAML 
document. YAML supports multiple documents, and compliant parsers will recognize 
each set of dashes as the beginning of a new one. 

key-value pairs
The “doe” is a key that points to a string value: “a deer, a female deer”. YAML supports more than just string values. The file starts with six key-value pairs. They have four different data types. “doe” and “ray” are strings. The “pi” is a floating-point number. The “xmas” is a boolean. The “french-hens” is an integer. You can enclose strings in single(‘) or double-quotes(“) or no quotes at all. YAML recognizes unquoted numerals as integers or floating point.

array
The seventh item is an array. The “calling-birds” has four elements, each denoted by an opening dash. I indented the elements in “calling-birds” with two spaces. Indentation is how YAML denotes nesting. The number of spaces can vary from file to file, but tabs are not allowed. 

dictionary
Finally, we see “xmas-fifth-day”, which has five more elements inside it, each of them indented. We can view “xmas-fifth-day” as a dictionary that contains two string, two integers, and another dictionary. YAML supports nesting of key-values, and mixing types.

Whitespaces as indentation
Whitespace is part of YAML's formatting. Unless otherwise indicated, newlines indicate the end of a field. You structure a YAML document with indentation. The indentation level can be one or more spaces. The specification forbids tabs because tools treat them differently.

Key-Value Pairs and Dictionaries
The key-value is YAML's basic building block. Every item in a YAML document is a member of at least one dictionary. The key is always a string. The value is a scalar so that it can be any datatype. So, as we've already seen, the value can be a string, a number, or another dictionary.
