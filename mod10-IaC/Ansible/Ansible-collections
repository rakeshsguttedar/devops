Ansible Collections

Ansible Collection is a collection of modules.

Why Ansible came up with the Collections?
When the number of modules increased, managing them became difficult.
Hence, from Ansible version >2.9, ansible categorized related modules 
into a collection and came up with Ansible Collections.

For a list of Ansible collections:

How do you use or refer a module from the collection?

A module in a collection is referred in the ansible playbook
using Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN)

Example:
For using/referring apt module from the Ansible.Builtin collection
FQCN: ansible.builtin.apt

# Example playbook file for using apt module inside Ansible.Builtin collection
- name: Install Apache
  hosts: webserver
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install apache2 # (state=present is optional) 
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
