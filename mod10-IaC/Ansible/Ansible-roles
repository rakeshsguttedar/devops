Anisble Roles

What problems does Anisble roles solve? or why Roles?

With more and more plays and tasks added to an Ansible playbook,
the size and complexity of the playbook increases. It will become
hard to maintain the playbook. Therefore in order to manage the 
complexity of writing ansible playbooks there was a need felt
to organise ansible playbook and make it more resusable. Ansible 
Roles came into being to solve this problem.

Ansible roles provide a higher level of organization and modularity compared 
to plays alone. While plays define a set of tasks to be executed on hosts, 
roles encapsulate a collection of plays, tasks, variables, and handlers into 
a reusable and self-contained unit.

What are some benefits of using Ansible roles?

Ansible roles provides us a template for creating other roles. Hence they are
reusable and thus can be shared with collaborators of a project.

What are handlers?
Handlers are special tasks that are only executed if a task notifies them. 
They are typically used to restart services or perform other actions that 
should only happen if a change has been made.

# handlers handson
---
- name: Install apache
  hosts: webserver
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      notify:
        - Restart Apache
    # other tasks follow from here..

handlers:
  - name: Restart Apache
    service:
      name: apache2
      state: restarted
