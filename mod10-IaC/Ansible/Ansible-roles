Anisble Roles

To manage the complexity of writing the ansible playbooks 
there was a need felt to organise ansible playbook.
Therefore Ansible Roles came into being.

Ansible roles provide a higher level of organization and modularity compared 
to plays alone. While plays define a set of tasks to be executed on hosts, 
roles encapsulate a collection of plays, tasks, variables, and handlers into 
a reusable and self-contained unit.
