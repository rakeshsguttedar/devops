Jenkins-Ansible

Integrating an Ansible playbook into a Jenkins pipeline job.

There are two ways we can configure Jenkins and Ansible to install
a package in the managed node.

1. Control Node has both Ansible and Jenkins installed and we are going to
   install Nexus in the managed node by running Jenkins job in the control node
   which will run Ansible to install Nexus in the Managed node.

2. Jenkins is installed in the master node and it will use Jenkins slave node
   to run jenkins job. The jenkins job in slave node will run ansible as a 
   control node and install Nexus in the manaed node. 

We are going to setup Jenkins-Ansible using configuration 1.

Steps:
1. Start t2.medium EC2 instance for running control Node and Jenkins 
2. In control Node, run ssh-keygen to create a key-pair
3. Copy the content of public key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and append to
   ~/.ssh/authrorized_keys file of the managed node.
4. Install Jenkins in the Control Node.
4. Copy the content of private key ~/.ssh/id_rsa to
   credential store in Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins with 
   username as root (instead of copying the file path in the inventory file)
5. Copy the content of the Jenkinsfile to the jenkins pipeline job in Jenkins
6. Build the Jenkins Pipeline job to install and start Neuxs Server in the 
   managed node using Ansible.
