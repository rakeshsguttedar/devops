Docker Volumes

docker containers are ephemeral in nature. That means, the data created and 
stored inside the docker containers is deleted when container is stopped,
restarted or removed.

There are three ways we can retain and store the container data across 
container lifecycle:

1. Bind Mount or Host-Mounted Volumes 
2. Anonymous Volumes or tmpfs 
3. Volumes or Named Volumes
